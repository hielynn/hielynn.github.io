					Speaking of the foundation of the BnB, the story is long and intriguing. At first, it was built by a big boy with his cousin. The original goal was simple: He wanted to build a simple BnB that can be coexist with  the beautiful nature. And the dream prompted the boy to leave his college and stepped into an unknown path.
				</p>
				<p>
					The founder, He Pei-Jun, has been determined throughout his founding of the business. He wants the B&B to keep the simplest appearance. “A Yard in the Sky” strives to associate with environmentally friendly concept and builds connection with local culture. It takes the goal seriously. The building has made of local materials and the food comes from local ingredients. Besides, In order to keep the cleanliness in the environment, the guests should put an effort as well. For example, we should be aware of the behaviors and the volume at night. It is suggested that we stay in our own rooms and be quiet after ten p.m. Lastly, every public resource has to be fully cleaned up before being placed to the original sites.

				<h1>A Yard in the Sky – an unforgettable B&B trip</h1>
				<p>
					 Five years ago, my family booked a two-day trip in a Nantou BnB. When we were wondering about where to go in a summer vacation, we found an unusual name called “A Yard in the Sky” on the booking website. In this BnB, there is no television, billiard table, or any other multimedia equipment. There is a butler. Besides, the surrounding area is full of bamboo and a pond with animals such as lizards, frogs, or geese. Although we had heard of a good reputation of the place, there were still a little worries and doubts before the trip. But, eventually, the BnB turned out to be a wonderful place for our relaxing family trip. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The BnB doesn’t have many guests events, but it owns amazing scenery and a comfortable environment. Therefore, we never felt a second of the monotony in the BnB. Also, even without fancy facilities, there was a wooden library catching my attention in the first sight. It had a delicate design with a set of comfortable chairs and table. All the bookshelves lied in the back of the room, creating a large space in the middle area. They demonstrated an open layout and produced a cozy atmosphere. Every visitor could easily step inside the room and set themselves in the favorite seats. Afterwards, they could enjoy an abundance of book resource within a tranquil and soothing atmosphere.My family really liked the place, and we spent a long while in the small library at our first and the only night.
				<p>
					In addition to the public facility, we also enjoyed our meals in the BnB a lot. The plates in “A Yard in the Sky” were mainly Hakka cuisine, reflecting an authentic and traditional taste. Since the ingredients didn’t come from the outside, the food seemed heathier and more environmentally friendly. Furthermore, the wooden containers were so elegant with traditional Chinese poems on the lids that we couldn’t help taking numerous photos. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Coming to the end of the first day, we were all satisfied with our new residence and this “yard in the sky”. It is surprising and inspiring that the simplest design of a building in a lush woods can actually achieve a goal of being coexisted with the nature. For the city guests, like my family, the place has provided a temporary shelter that enables us to rest from the hustling and bustling in lives. In the mesantime, the BnB also strikes a balance between protecting the nature and maintaining a business. All in all, by holding a sustainable attitude and seeking harmony with the local regions, “A Yard in the Sky” literally creates a paradise on the ground and lives up to its fame.

					五年前的暑假，我們家在南投一間名為「天空的院子」的民宿訂了一個兩天一夜的行程。透過簡潔幾行的內容介紹中，發現到民宿中的設備堪稱簡陋，其中沒有唱歌房、球桌、或者任何媒體影音設備，各種疑難雜事有一位管家負責打理，民宿也無附帶手工藝活動或者農場參觀等體驗，留給旅客的僅僅有乾淨舒適的房間與美麗幽靜的自然環境。雖然民宿小有名氣，但這趟未知旅程也帶來許多懷疑與擔憂，直到最後我們親身走訪民宿後，所有疑慮才逐漸消融，並在我們心中留下對於旅途深刻的回憶。
				</p>
				<p>
					這間民宿的創始故事並不簡單。當初是由一位毅然停學的大男孩與表哥白手起家，秉持最純粹的想法創業。民宿的主人何培鈞想要在竹林間打造與自然共存的棲所，令到訪的旅客能暫時拋卻城市喧囂而回歸鄉林間。因此「天空的院子」的經營始終與簡樸和環保的概念作為結合，建築使用當地木材；餐點也來自在地食材、並帶有客家文化。在房客入住的期間，所有人也需一同努力來維護環境的整潔，十點之後盡量要保持安靜並且待在房內，最後，使用完公共設備後，則需要好好清潔後才能放回原位。
