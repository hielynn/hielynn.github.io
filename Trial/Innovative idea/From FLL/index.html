			<h1>The Bicentennial Man</h1>
			<p>Andrew Martin said, "Thank you," and took the seat offered him. He
didn't look driven to the last resort, but he had been.
He didn't, actually, look anything, for there was a smooth blankness, to
his face, except for the sadness one imagined one saw in his eyes. His hair
was smooth, light brown, rather fine; and he had no facial hair. He looked
freshly and cleanly shaved. His clothes were distinctly old-fashioned, but
neat, and predominantly a velvety red-purple in color.
Facing him from behind the desk was the surgeon. The nameplate on
the desk included a fully identifying series of letters and numbers which
Andrew didn't bother with. To call him Doctor would be quite enough.
"When can the operation be carried through, Doctor?" he asked.
Softly, with that certain inalienable note of respect that a robot always
used to a human being, the surgeon said, "I am not certain, sir, that I
understand how or upon whom such an operation could be performed."
There might have been a look of respectful intransigence on the
surgeon's face, if a robot of his sort, in lightly bronzed stainless steel,
could have such an expression- or any expression.
Andrew Martin studied the robot's right hand, his cutting hand, as it
lay motionless on the desk. The fingers were long and were shaped into
artistically metallic, looping curves so graceful and appropriate that one
could imagine a scalpel fitting them and becoming, temporarily, one piece
with them. There would be no hesitation in his work, no stumbling, no
quivering, no mistakes. That confidence came with specialization, of
course, a specialization so fiercely desired by humanity that few robots
were, any longer, independently brained. A surgeon, of course, would
have to be. But this one, though brained, was so limited in his capacity
that he did not recognize Andrew, had probably never heard of him.
"Have you ever thought you would like to be a man?" Andrew asked.
The surgeon hesitated a moment, as though the question fitted
nowhere in his allotted positronic pathways. "But I am a robot, sir."
"Would it be better to be a man?"
"If would be better, sir, to be a better surgeon. I could not be so if I
were a man, but only if I were a more advanced robot. I would be pleased
194
to be a more advanced robot."
"It does not offend you that I can order you about? That I can make
you stand up, sit down, move right or left, by merely telling you to do so?"
"It is my pleasure to please you, sir. If your orders were to interfere
with my functioning with respect to you or to any other human being, I
would not obey you. The First Law, concerning my duty to human safety,
would take precedence over the Second Law relating to obedience.
Otherwise, obedience is my pleasure. Now, upon whom am I to perform
this operation?"
"Upon me," Andrew said.
"But that is impossible. It is patently a damaging operation."
"That does not matter," said Andrew, calmly. "I must not inflict
damage," said the surgeon. "On a human being, you must not," said
Andrew, "but I, too, am a robot."</p>

				Andrew had appeared much more a robot when he had first been manufactured. He had then been as much a robot in appearance as any that
had ever existed, smoothly designed and functional.
He had done well in the home to which he had been brought in those
days when robots in households, or on the planet altogether, had been a
rarity. There had been four in the home: Sir and Ma'am and Miss and
Little Miss. He knew their names, of course, but he never used them. Sir
was Gerald Martin.
His own serial number was NDR- He eventually forgot the numbers. It
had been a long time, of course; but if he had wanted to remember, he
could not have forgotten. He had not wanted to remember.
Little Miss had been the first to call him Andrew, because she could
not use the letters, and all the rest followed her in this.
Little Miss- She had lived for ninety years and was long since dead.
He had tried to call her Ma'am once, but she would not allow it. Little
Miss she had been to her last day.
Andrew had been intended to perform the duties of a valet, a butler,
even a lady's maid. Those were the experimental days for him and, indeed,
for all robots anywhere save in the industrial and exploratory factories and
stations off Earth.

The Martins enjoyed him, and half the time he was prevented from
doing his work because Miss and Little Miss wanted to play with him. It
was Miss who first understood how this might be arranged. "We order you
to play with us and you must follow orders."
"I am sorry, Miss, but a prior order from Sir must surely take
precedence."
But she said, "Daddy just said he hoped you would take care of the
cleaning. That's not much of an order. I order you."
Sir did not mind. Sir was fond of Miss and of Little Miss, even more
than Ma'am was; and Andrew was fond of them, too. At least, the effect
they had upon his actions were those which in a human being would have
been called the result of fondness. Andrew thought of it as fondness for he
did not know any other word for it.
It was for Little Miss that Andrew had carved a pendant out of wood.
She had ordered him to. Miss, it seemed, had received an ivorite pendant
with scrollwork for her birthday and Little Miss was unhappy over it. She
had only a piece of wood, which she gave Andrew together with a small
kitchen knife.
He had done it quickly and Little Miss had said, "That's nice, Andrew.
I'll show it to Daddy."
Sir would not believe it. "Where did you really get this, Mandy?"
Mandy was what he called Little Miss. When Little Miss assured him she
was really telling the truth, he turned to Andrew. "Did you do this,
Andrew?"
"Yes, Sir."
"The design, too?"
"Yes, Sir."
"From what did you copy the design?"
"It is a geometric representation, Sir, that fits the grain of the wood."
The next day, Sir brought him another piece of wood- a larger one and an electric vibro-knife. "Make something out of this, Andrew.
Anything you want to," he said.
Andrew did so as Sir watched, then looked at the product a long time.
After that, Andrew no longer waited on tables. He was ordered to read
books on furniture design instead, and he learned to make cabinets and
desks.
"These are amazing productions, Andrew," Sir soon told him.
"I enjoy doing them, Sir," Andrew admitted.
"Enjoy?"
196
"It makes the circuits of my brain somehow flow more easily. I have
heard you use the word `enjoy' and the way you use it fits the way I feel. I
enjoy doing them, Sir."
